react-intl-db
=============

Load i18n domains for Format.js's React integration.

To install the required dependencies::

$ npm install

To try this out can use the webpack-dev-server, which automatically
rebuilds the bundle and serves the content in ``build`` like this::

$ webpack-dev-server --progress --colors --content-base build

You can then access the app http://localhost:8080
